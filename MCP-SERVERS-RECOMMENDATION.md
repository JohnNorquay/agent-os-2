## Integration Strategy for Agent-OS-2

### Phase 1: Core Essentials (Recommended Now)
Add these to your global `~/.claude/mcp.json`:

1. **Filesystem** - Essential for all file operations
2. **GitHub** - Critical for repository management
3. **Playwright** - Powerful for web automation

### Phase 2: Collaboration Tools (Add as needed)
4. **Slack** - When you need team notifications
5. **Git** - For local repository operations

### Phase 3: Specialized (Project-specific)
6. **Postgres** - Only if working with databases
7. Others based on specific project needs

---

## Configuration Considerations

### Security Best Practices

1. **Filesystem**: Always specify allowed directories
   ```json
   "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
            "/home/ohn_orquay/projects",
            "/home/ohn_orquay/.claude/plugins"]
   ```

2. **GitHub**: Use tokens with minimal required scopes
   - `repo` for private repos
   - `public_repo` for public repos only
   - `read:org` if needed

3. **Slack**: Use bot tokens, not user tokens
   - Limit channel access with SLACK_CHANNEL_IDS

4. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data securely
   - Don't commit tokens to Git
   - Use environment variables where possible

### Performance Considerations

**NPX servers**: First run downloads packages (may take time)
- Subsequent runs are cached
- Consider pre-installing with `npm install -g <package>`

**Server startup**: More servers = longer initial startup
- Start with essential servers
- Add more as needed

**Resource usage**: Each server is a running process
- Monitor with `ps aux | grep mcp`
- Typically lightweight (Node.js processes)

## Comparison with Your Current Setup

### Current MCP Servers:
- chat-claude (custom)
- vercel (custom wrapper)
- flyio (custom wrapper)
- supabase-PickSix (official)
- supabase-IntegrationDirector (official)

### Adding Popular Servers:
- **Filesystem**: New capability - file operations
- **GitHub**: Complements your current deployment servers
- **Playwright**: New capability - browser automation
- **Slack**: New capability - team communication
- **Git**: Complements GitHub for local operations

**No conflicts** - these integrate seamlessly with your existing setup!

## Installation Steps

I can help you integrate these servers. Here's the process:

1. **Backup current config**
   ```bash
   cp ~/.claude/mcp.json ~/.claude/mcp.json.backup
   ```

2. **Update global config** with new servers

3. **Obtain required credentials**:
   - GitHub Personal Access Token
   - Slack Bot Token (if using Slack)

4. **Test each server** after adding

5. **Verify with verification script**

---

## Recommendation

**Integrate Phase 1 servers immediately:**
- ✅ Filesystem (essential)
- ✅ GitHub (essential)
- ✅ Playwright (powerful)

**Add Phase 2 later as needed:**
- ⏸ Slack (when you need team communication)
- ⏸ Git (when you need local Git operations)

**Skip Phase 3 unless specific need:**
- ⏸ Postgres (only if using databases)
- ⏸ Fetch (you already have WebFetch)

This gives you a powerful, comprehensive agent-os-2 system that works across all project types! 🚀

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Update your global `mcp.json` with the recommended servers?
2. Help you obtain the required tokens (GitHub, Slack)?
3. Create a testing plan to verify all servers work?
4. Update the verification scripts to include the new servers?

Let me know and I'll proceed!
