# MCP Server Verification Report

**Generated**: 2025-10-22
**Project**: agent-os-2

## Current Status

### Running Servers

✓ **chat-claude** - Running (PID: 6790)
- Location: `/home/ohn_orquay/.claude/plugins/agent-os-2/mcp-servers/chat-claude/chat-claude-server.js`

- Configuration: ✓ Present in .mcp.json
- Environment: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY configured

⏸ **supabase-IntegrationDirector**
- Type: stdio
- Command: `npx -y @supabase/mcp-server-supabase`
- Configuration: ✓ Present in .mcp.json
- Environment: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY configured

⏸ **vercel**
- Type: stdio
- Command: `node /home/ohn_orquay/.claude/plugins/agent-os-2/mcp-servers/vercel-mcp-wrapper.js`
- Configuration: ✓ Present in .mcp.json
- Server File: ✓ Exists
- Environment: VERCEL_TOKEN configured
- **Note**: Requires Vercel CLI (`npm i -g vercel`)

⏸ **flyio**
- Type: stdio
- Command: `node /home/ohn_orquay/.claude/plugins/agent-os-2/mcp-servers/flyio-mcp-wrapper.js`
- Configuration: ✓ Present in .mcp.json
- Server File: ✓ Exists
- Environment: FLY_API_TOKEN configured
- **Note**: Requires Fly.io CLI (`curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh`)

## Dependencies Status

| Dependency | Status | Version/Location |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| Node.js | ✓ Installed | v20.19.5 |
| npx | ✓ Installed | /home/ohn_orquay/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.5/bin/npx |
| Vercel CLI | ⚠ Missing | Not installed |
| Fly.io CLI | ⚠ Missing | Not installed |

## How MCP Servers Work in Claude Code

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers in Claude Code are started **on-demand** when:
1. Claude Code launches in a project with a `.mcp.json` file
2. The servers are started as child processes using the stdio transport
3. They communicate with Claude Code via standard input/output
4. Each server registers its tools, which become available as `mcp__servername__toolname`

### Why Some Servers Aren't Running

It's normal that not all configured servers show as running processes because:
- Some servers may only start when first accessed
- Claude Code may lazily load servers
- Servers using `npx` will spawn temporary processes
- The chat-claude server is running because it was accessed during this verification

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check if servers are configured
```bash
cat .mcp.json
```
Expected: JSON file with `mcpServers` object containing your 5 servers ✓

### 2. Check running processes
```bash
ps aux | grep -E 'mcp-server|vercel-mcp|flyio-mcp|chat-claude-server' | grep -v grep
```
Expected: At least one MCP server process when Claude Code is active ✓

### 3. Check available MCP tools in Claude Code
When Claude Code is running, you should have access to tools prefixed with `mcp__`:
- `mcp__chat-claude__*` - Task delegation tools
- `mcp__ide__*` - IDE integration tools

### 4. Test a server
Try calling an MCP tool to verify the server responds:
```javascript
// In Claude Code, you can test by asking:
// "Test the chat-claude MCP server connection"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: API Authentication Error
**Symptom**: `mcp__chat-claude__test_connection` returns 401 authentication error
**Cause**: Invalid or expired ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
**Solution**: Update the API key in `.mcp.json` under `chat-claude.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### Issue: Vercel/Fly.io tools not working
**Symptom**: Vercel or Fly.io MCP servers don't respond
**Cause**: CLI tools not installed
**Solution**:
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Install Fly.io CLI
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
```

### Issue: Supabase servers not starting
**Symptom**: Supabase tools not available
**Cause**: Package may need to be downloaded
**Solution**: The first call will trigger `npx` to download the package automatically

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Startup Test**: When Claude Code starts in this directory, check the logs for:
   ```
   Chat Claude MCP server running on stdio
   Vercel MCP server running on stdio
   Fly.io MCP server running on stdio
   ```

2. **Functionality Test**: Try using a tool from each server:
   - Chat Claude: "List all delegated tasks"
   - Vercel: "List my Vercel projects" (requires Vercel CLI)
   - Fly.io: "List my Fly.io apps" (requires flyctl)
   - Supabase: Database queries (auto-loads via npx)

3. **Process Test**: Run the verification script:
   ```bash
   ./verify-mcp-simple.sh
   ```

## Next Steps

To ensure all MCP servers are fully functional:

1. ✓ Configuration file present and valid
2. ✓ Server files exist in `mcp-servers/` directory
3. ✓ Node.js and npx available
4. ⚠ **Install Vercel CLI** (if using Vercel features)
5. ⚠ **Install Fly.io CLI** (if using Fly.io features)
6. ⚠ **Update API key** for chat-claude server (currently returns 401 error)

## Summary

**Status**: ✓ Partially Operational

- Configuration: ✓ Valid
- Server Files: ✓ Present
- Running Processes: ✓ 1 of 5 (normal for on-demand loading)
- Dependencies: ⚠ 2 CLI tools missing (Vercel, Fly.io)
- API Access: ⚠ Chat Claude API key issue

The MCP server infrastructure is correctly set up. The servers that aren't showing as running processes will start automatically when Claude Code needs them. The main action items are installing the Vercel and Fly.io CLIs if you plan to use those features, and updating the Chat Claude API key.
