# ✅ Your Email Is Already Configured!

## Your Gmail Setup

Your email credentials are already in `.env.example`:

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com

SMTP_USER=john.norquay@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=hsyo iaez hmzw dgum

```

And email notifications are **enabled by default** in `config.yml`!

```

## 🎚️ Customize Notifications

### Receive More Updates

```yaml
# Edit config.yml
email:
  notify_on:
    - task_started           # When each layer starts
    - task_completed         # When each layer finishes
    - verification_complete  # When verification passes
    - deployment_complete    # When deployed to staging
    - feature_complete       # When everything done
    - critical_error         # If something goes wrong
```

### Receive Fewer Updates (Just Essentials)

```yaml
email:
  notify_on:
    - feature_complete  # Only when fully done
    - critical_error    # Only if needs your help
```

### Don't Get Woken Up

```yaml
notifications:
  quiet_hours:
    enabled: true
    start: "22:00"  # 10 PM
    end: "08:00"    # 8 AM
    timezone: America/New_York
    behavior: queue  # Save notifications until morning
    exceptions:
      - critical_error  # Always send these
```

---

## 🎯 Recommended Settings (For You)

Based on typical usage, I recommend:

```yaml
email:
  enabled: true
  notify_on:
    - feature_complete      # Get email when feature done
    - verification_complete # Get email when verified
    - critical_error        # Get email if stuck

quiet_hours:
  enabled: true
  start: "22:00"
  end: "08:00"
```

This gives you:
- ✅ Notification when feature completes (with all details)
- ✅ Notification when verification passes
- ✅ Notification if AI gets stuck
- ✅ No notifications between 10pm-8am
- ✅ Sleep peacefully, build autonomously!
